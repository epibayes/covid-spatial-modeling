### Abstract

The mainstream of statistical epidemiology focuses on modeling the spread of disease in a homogeneous population over time, but it can be difficult to reason about varying transmission risk factors within a population level using this approach. We consider the problem of spatiotemporal modeling of the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Michigan. Does spatial segregation by class, race, and other social factors inform the dynamics of infection? We can analyze death certificates, hospital infection records, and even cellphone mobility data to identify geographic patterns. We are looking for an undergraduate researcher interested in public health and spatial statistics to help with data analysis, model implementation, and visualization. In future work, we hope to use machine learning techniques (e.g. convolutional neural networks) to learn spatial correlations from multi-
format infection data at scale.
